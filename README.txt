# Final Year Project: Eye and Hair Color Detection

## Project Name
Eye and Hair Color Detection

## Problem It Solves
This project automates the detection of eye and hair colors using images or real-time video feeds. It leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify colors and classify features accurately, reducing manual effort in similar detection tasks.

## Steps to Run
1. **Set up your environment**:
   - Install Python 3.7 or higher.
   - Install required libraries using the command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Prepare the dataset**:
   - Extract `data.rar` into the `data/` folder in the project directory.

3. **Run the scripts**:
   - Real-time detection: `python src/realtime.py`
   - Capture images: `python src/capture.py`
   - Train the model: `python src/main_training.py`
   - Test the model: `python src/main_testing.py`

4. **Enjoy results**:
   - Use the scripts for detecting eye and hair colors on real-time feeds or saved images.
